Your Assignment
Using Laravel, create a simple classified Ads backend, implementing the following user stories:
 As a user I can register with the webapp using email and name.
 As a user, I can login to the application. Using passport / JWT or any authentication methods
 As a user, I can reset my password via email
 As an authenticated user, I can create a post (ad) with a required title, description, and contact
phone number. Description is limited to 2 KB in size.
 As an authenticated user, I can upload an image for a created post. This image might be huge, so
it should be processed in the background.
 As a user, I can see a paginated list of posts created by other users. The list includes the title and
description of each post limited to 512 characters, and sorted so that most recent posts appear
first.
 As an authenticated user, I can view any post. The view should include all information in addition
to the user name who posted it.
 List all specific user posts
 Use unit testing to cover all API’s
 use migration and seeder for database
 use AdminLTE or any dashboard to manage all Entities
 use Laravel ORM to make relation between entities
You are expected to develop a Web API backend only as json and dashboard to manage all
characters. All API endpoints should return JSON Payloads and accept inputs as json payloads
and/or URL parameters.
Bonus points
 Secure your app from DDOS attack
 Automated tests
 real time notification for admin when adding new post’s
 Registration with social accounts like (Gmail, Facebook, LinkedIn)
 Using Design Patterns and SOLID Principles
 Using Laravel Command that name install:project name like(php artisan install:project name) *
that command will run migration and seeder automatically *
Output
1- Upload Your Code using repo (GitHub or Gitlab or Bitbucket)
2- A Swagger YAML file, or a postman collection documenting available APIs, included in root of
the archive mentioned in (1) above.
3- A readme.md file included in the root of the archive mentioned in (1) above, detailing how to
setup the product for deployment and testing.
Good Luck!
